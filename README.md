# RevConnect – Console-Based Social Media Application
- Project Overview

RevConnect is a console-based social media application developed using Java, JDBC, and MySQL. It provides a platform for personal users, business accounts, and content creators to connect, share posts, interact with content, and build networks.

The application follows a modular architecture (UI, DAO, Utility, and App layers) and is designed to be scalable and extendable into a microservices-based web or mobile application in future phases.
